This app is built on Express in Node.js. If you have Node.js installed, run the app by running the command "node app.js" or "npm start".
Then, look at what port the app is listening on in the terminal output. 
The base URI for requests will then be localhost:port

There is also an sqlite database used in this project. There is already one sample user in the database that you can use for testing.
